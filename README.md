# Meshtastic-DIY

Dear friends. If you have just learned what a Meshtastic-radio network is, if you are interested in the topic, if you already have a radio modem, and you would like to breathe life into it, then â€¦
I have written a large series of 4 articles for the Russian-speaking community. This is more than the usual FAQ. This is a complete guide to action.
At the moment, the articles are written in Russian for a Russian-speaking audience. You can easily translate the article in your google chrome browser into your national language. Perhaps the Google translation will be slightly incorrect, with inaccuracies or errors.
Also, I am considering translating the article into real technical English.
